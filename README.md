# Face Detection and Counting in Videos using YOLOv5

## Overview

This project is designed to capture and detect faces in user-provided videos using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. We've extended the YOLOv5 inference code to count the number of unique faces in the video and display this count on the video itself. The goal is to provide a simple and effective solution for face detection and counting in videos.

## Our Trained Model

We've trained our own YOLOv5 model to excel at face detection tasks. You can download our trained model from the following Google Drive link:
